# ProbationReplicate
 This repository contains the replication code for my research proposal "Uncertainty, Sudden Stops and Macroprudential Policies"
 
 It requires the markov Discretization package by farmer and toda (2017)
    which can be found https://github.com/alexisakira/discretization
    Notice that the code is under GNU License

 To solve the model, first run RunSolvePlot.m. It will generate Figure 1,2 
    and 3

 To do the simulation, run RunSimulation.m and change line 28, it will 
    replicate Table 2, Figure 4, 5 and 6
